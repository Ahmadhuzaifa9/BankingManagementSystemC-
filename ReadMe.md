**Banking-Management-System**
This documentation provides an overview of two implementations for managing Banking Management System, one in Python and the other in C++.
**Python Code Implementation:**
**Description**
This Python-based system manages Banking System using CSV files for data storage. It utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate User account management (create, update, delete), Deposit and withdrawal operations, Fund transfer between accounts, Account balance inquiry, and Transaction history tracking.
**Features:**
•	User account management (create, update, delete)
•	Deposit and withdrawal operations
•	Fund transfer between accounts
•	Account balance inquiry
•	Transaction history tracking
•	Simple and intuitive GUI built with Python.

**How to Use:**
1.	Run the Program: Execute the Python file (main.py) in a Python environment.
2.	Menu Options: The GUI offers various options for Account creation, withdrawal funds, deposit funds, transfer fund, checking account details, checking transaction history, delete account.
3.	Creating/transferring/Removing/Checking: Use respective buttons to proceeds respective functions.
4.	Data Storage: Account data is stored in CSV files (Account.csv).
**Functionality:**
•	Creating Account: Use the respective "Create Acc" button and follow the prompts to input necessary data.
•	Deposit/Withdraw/Transfer: Select an entry from menu and click the corresponding button and prompt the required details.
•	Display: Select an entry, click "details" or “History” buttons and input the new details as prompted.
•	Removing/change password: Select an entry, click "Change Password " button to change the account password by fulfilling required condition or “Delete Account” button to delete the respective account by prompting the new details as required.
**Usage:**
•	Dependencies: Python 3.x, tkinter library.
•	Installation: Clone the repository and ensure the necessary CSV files are in the same directory as the code.
•	Run the Program: Execute the Python script to launch the GUI.
**Acknowledgments:**
Acknowledging contributions from developers:
•	Huzaifa Ahmad: Acknowledging pivotal role and contributions in improving the system's performance and reliability.
•	Ameer Hamza: Recognizing valuable contributions that strengthened the system's capabilities and usability.
**C++ Code Implementation:**
Overview: The C++ code implementation of the Banking Management System features similar functionalities to the Python version with some enhancements in structure, functions, file handling, and error messages.
**Key Modifications:**
•	Better Structured Classes: Utilizes inheritance and improved function definitions.
•	Refined Functions: Compact methods in optimizing inheritance usage.
•	Enhanced Error Handling: Detailed and informative error messages for clearer user feedback.
**Usage:**
As this code is in C++, it might require a different development environment and compilation steps compared to Python. Specific instructions regarding compiling and executing this code in a C++ environment would be included with the source code.
